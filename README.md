and potential login issues can be easily solved. However, since [Quotex
is
unregulated](\%22https://eseta.org.za/quotex/\%22){target=""_blank""
rel=""noreferrer""} and banned in specific countries, it has to
change its domain name and login page URL from time to time. These
unilateral changes may disfavor you, which can harm your personal
information and money in the future.

It's also important to note that Quotex collects your personal data and
can use or disclose it for marketing purposes without any control, as no
regulatory bodies restrict them.
